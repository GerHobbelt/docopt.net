# **docopt.net** is a .NET implementation of [docopt]

**docopt.net** is a parser for command-line arguments. It automatically derives
the parsing logic from the help text of a program containing its command-line
usage in [docopt] format. [docopt] is the formalization of conventions that have
been used for decades in help messages and man pages for describing a program's
interface. Below is an example of such a help text containing the usage for a
hypothetical program called Naval Fate:

    Naval Fate.

    Usage:
      naval_fate.exe ship new <name>...
      naval_fate.exe ship <name> move <x> <y> [--speed=<kn>]
      naval_fate.exe ship shoot <x> <y>
      naval_fate.exe mine (set|remove) <x> <y> [--moored | --drifting]
      naval_fate.exe (-h | --help)
      naval_fate.exe --version

    Options:
      -h --help     Show this screen.
      --version     Show version.
      --speed=<kn>  Speed in knots [default: 10].
      --moored      Moored (anchored) mine.
      --drifting    Drifting mine.

## Usage

The following C# example shows one basic way to use **docopt.net**:

```c#
#nullable enable

using System;
using DocoptNet;

const string usage = @"Naval Fate.

Usage:
  naval_fate.exe ship new <name>...
  naval_fate.exe ship <name> move <x> <y> [--speed=<kn>]
  naval_fate.exe ship shoot <x> <y>
  naval_fate.exe mine (set|remove) <x> <y> [--moored | --drifting]
  naval_fate.exe (-h | --help)
  naval_fate.exe --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.
  --speed=<kn>  Speed in knots [default: 10].
  --moored      Moored (anchored) mine.
  --drifting    Drifting mine.

";

var arguments = new Docopt().Apply(usage, args, version: "Naval Fate 2.0", exit: true)!;
foreach (var (key, value) in arguments)
    Console.WriteLine("{0} = {1}", key, value);
```
